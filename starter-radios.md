## Buying a Radio

### Where to shop?

Because Amateur Radio is a niche hobby, it's hard to know where to look. Here are some places to look.

* **Hamfests**. These are ham radio swap meets, great places to pick up new and used equipment at discounted prices. Be sure to research what you want before you go so that you can make informed buying decisions. A lot of vendors are as interested in talking about their equipment as they as selling it, so don't hesitate to ask questions. You can find local hamfests on www.bcars.org or http://www.arrl.org/hamfests/search
* **QRZ.com forums**. QRZ.com is one of the more popular places for hams to buy and sell gear.  https://forums.qrz.com/
* **Ham Radio Outlet**. HRO is one of the most respected retail outlets for ham radio equipment. They have both online and physical locations. https://www.hamradio.com/
* **DX Engineering**. For all station accessories and antennas to the cable assemblies, clamps, and hardware that bring it all together. https://www.dxengineering.com/
* **MFJ Enterprises** - if you need an antenna, get it here. http://www.mfjenterprises.com/
* EBay - ebay is another good place to find specific ham radio gear. Ebay and Paypal provides the most buyer protection, however a lot of sellers on ebay price their equipment higher than market value. 



## What to look for?

### Baofeng UV-5R

The Baofeng line of radios have quickly become a favorite for new and veteran hams. The UV-5R can be picked up for around $25 bucks and is pretty resilient to damage. The UV-5R is a dual band radio covering 2M and 70cm bands. Hams that have more expensive handhelds often pick up a UV-5R because they can be treated much rougher and with less care than a more expensive radio. 

Programming the UV-5R by hand is difficult to learn, and we recommend you pick up a computer programming cable. The website www.miklor.com covers a lot of these Chinese radios, including a very comprehensive fan-made manual \(http://www.miklor.com/uv5r/UV5R-Manuals.html\).

### Kennwood TM-281 

The Kenwood TM-281 is a single band, 2M mobile radio. The TM-281 is picked because it is rather inexpensive at $135 and often goes on sale for less
