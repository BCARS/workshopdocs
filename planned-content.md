## **What is a radio frequency? What is a wavelength? A 2 minute primer.**

A radio wave is a form of electromagnetic radiation. Each wave cycles to a peak and then falls to a low point \(a trough\). The number of cycles made within 1 second is called the frequency and is measured in "Herz" or "cycles per second". If someone says a frequency is 1 kilohertz \(1khz\), than that radio wave completes 1 million cycles per second.

All radio waves travel at the same speed, which is the speed of light in a vacuum, with some minor slowdown occurring when traveling through gas or solids. The distance a radio wave travels in one second, in a vacuum, is 299,792,458 meters. **This number is pretty important, but to make it easier to remember, most calculations involving it round up to use 300,000,000 meters/second. For our purposes, that is the distance a radio wave travels in one second.**

A **wavelength** is the the distance a radio wave will travel before completing one cycle. A frequency of 1 Hertz will travel 300,000,000 meters before completing one cycle. Therefore, the wavelength of 1Hz is 300,000,000 meters.** If you scale that up, a frequency of 1Mhz \(1 million cycles per second\) is 300,000,000meters/1,000,000Hz = 300m/1Mhz = 300 Meters.**

To make that simple, if you have a frequency in Megahertz, divide 300 into it to get the wavelength. From this, we realize that the longer the wavelength, the lower the frequency.

## **But why is wavelength even important? **

Wavelength is important when designing an antenna. The wavelength of a frequency is in fact, the length you want an antenna to be in order for it to best receive and transmit on that frequency. Furthermore, once you know a wavelength, you can divide that into fractions to come up with smaller, more manageable antennas.

Again, take 300, divide that by your frequency in Mhz. The number you get is the length of a full wavelength antenna in meters, which you can then divide down even smaller sizes. One thing to keep in mind is that you can do a fair amount of rounding in your math to keep things easy, and then fine tune your antenna to get the best match.

| Frequency | Wavelength | 5/8 | 1/2 | 1/4 |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 145.490Mhz | 2.06m/6.76ft/81in | 1.28m/4.2ft/50in | 1.03m/3.38ft/40.55in | .52m/1.7ft/19.5in |



## Amateur Radio Bands

Amateur Radio Bands are grouped by their wavelength.  Here is a chart provided by eham.net of the radio bands their most common usage. 

|  | **MHz** | **Use\*** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 160   HF | 1.8 - 2.0 | night |
| 80 HF | 3.5 - 4.0 | night and local day |
| 40 HF | 7.0 - 7.3 | night and local day |
| 30 HF | 10.1 - 10.15 | CW and digital |
| 20 HF | 14.0 - 14.350 | world wide day and night |
| 17 HF | 18.068 - 18.168 | world wide day and night |
| 15 HF | 21.0 - 21.450 | primarily a daytime band |
| 12 HF | 24.890 - 24.990 | primarily a daytime band |
| 10 HF | 28.0 - 29.70 | daytime during sunspot highs |
| 6   VHF | 50 - 54 | local to world-wide |
| 2   VHF | 144 - 148 | local and medium distance |
| 70 cm  UHF | 430 - 440 | local |
