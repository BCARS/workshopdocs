* [ ] ## Preparing for the FCC** Amateur Radio Licensed Exam**

BCARS believes that the real learning of amateur radio comes from being able to operate. To that end, we encourage potential licensees to study to pass the exam, with an understanding that you will be able to study the parts of amateur radio that interest you further and have the ability to put that knowledge into immediate, practical use.

The FCC exams are generated from a publicly available pool of questions and answers. A number of books, websites, and applications are available to review the entire question pool and take practice exams. Testing includes the three Amateur Radio license classes,**TECHNICIAN, GENERAL, and AMATEUR EXTRA**. There is a nominal non-refundable charge of fifteen dollars \($15.00\). In the past, BCARS has hosted "HAM IN A DAY" sessions, where people have been able to come in, study the question pool, and pass the exam all in one day. However, not everyone has been able to pass on the first day and many find it rather stressful. In 2018, BCARS has taken a new approach where we host a workshop and provide direction for a self-study program, and then offer the exam 2 weeks later. BCARS Volunteer Examiners \(VEs\) are available during this time to answer questions and provide additional information.

First off, we recommends you get the **KB6NU “No Nonsense Study Guide”**.  This book primarily covers the exam, but does present a detailed explanation of the answer. You can study this guide directly, or use it as a reference while reviewing the exam question pool. technician class is FREE, while General and Extra are available for a small fee.

**Physical Books:**

These books cover much more than the exam, going further into depth on technical areas. This is definitely the recommended approach for those that do not like memorizing questions and want to learn the theory behind them. When purchasing a physical book, pay close attention to the edition and validity of the question pool. **For 2018, the technician question pool changes in June**, at which point a number of websites and books will be providing new editions.

* The Ham Whisperer by  Andy Vellenga \(http://a.co/7N8lABZ\)  $15
* Gordon West' Technician Manual \(http://www.w5yi.org/catalog\_details.php?pid=76\) $22 

On the day of the exam, please bring a recent photo ID \(example: school ID, US passport, driver’s license\), or a current FCC license .
