## HOW TO BE A HAM

**FCC Amateur Radio Service Licensed VE Testing Program**

Please see upcoming events on the right hand column to find our next VE session.

The Bedford County Amateur Radio Society \(BCARS\) regularly hosts our “HAM CRAM” event. This is an exceptional opportunity for those interested in earning an amateur radio license.

“HAM CRAM” helps you review the actual FCC questions and correct answers in the morning followed by taking the FCC tests.

This training/test session is open to anyone. Certified Volunteer Examiners \(VE\) and licensed hams are on-hand to answer questions during the study. Testing start promptly at 2pm and will continue until 5pm.

Testing includes the three Amateur Radio license classes,**TECHNICIAN, GENERAL, and AMATEUR EXTRA**. The event is open to anyone. There is a nominal non-refundable charge of fifteen dollars. \($15.00\)

Please bring a recent photo ID \(example: school ID, US passport, driver’s license\), or a current FCC license . At the session, we will provide study materials \(booklets containing the actual FCC question and answer license pools\).

Ham in a Day is intended to be a fun and non-stressful way to get become a licensed amateur radio operator. Light snacks and refreshments will be provided. At our last Ham in a Day, we welcomed over a dozen new hams radio operators as well as several license upgrades.

If you are interested in studying before-hand, BCARS recommends you get the KB6NU “No Nonsense Study Guide”.  The technician class is FREE, while General and Extra are available for a small fee. [http://www.kb6nu.com/study-guides/](http://www.kb6nu.com/study-guides/)
